Structured Thermal Redefinition

Formal abstraction: Applying deliberate ratios across particular durations at various temperatures; trialed fridge, freezer, ambient; with sequencing partially relevant, alongside pressure differences, to materials, with effect of property modification.

Tested objects:

Electronics, including pc parts and headphones

Pills

### process for non-audio electronics:

Place in 3 sandwich ziploc bags (start ambient in ziploc bags for 5 minutes) Place in a freezer, atop porous wire rack, for 49 minutes. Carrying by ziploc zipper, place in fridge for 18 minutes. Allow at least 5 hour equilibration at room temp. note: tested with pressure difference such that fridge basement, freezer ground level, ambient 2nd floor 

### general process, more for restoration than modification:

Place in 3 sandwich ziploc bags. Place in freezer for 2 hours, 1 minute. Place in fridge for 83+ hours, carrying by ziploc zipper. Allow at least 18 hour equilibration at ambient. note: freezer and fridge at basement, potentially optimal setup is combinated small fridge/freezer apparatus apply proc 1, proc 2, proc 1 to optimize nord buds 2 in case

upside down letters on side in cold, then 4 hours mimicked orientation ambient, then 4 hours flipped orientation

### brief procedure:
31 sec freezer, 44 sec fridge, 15:37.5 ambient, 44 sec fridge, 31 sec freezer
triple ziploc bags
